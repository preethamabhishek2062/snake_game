Our aim is to feed the snake with its food using direction buttons.
As the snake eats food, it grows it length and our score increases by 5 everytime we feed it.
The speed at which out snake travels also increases as it eats food.

When the snake hits any of the 4 walls, it is Game over. A dialogue box will pop up saying it is game over and your score will be displayed along with buttons
to either restart the game or go to home page.
